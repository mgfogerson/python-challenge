# python-challenge
This project includes two Python apps that read locally stored data to return information about a bank's financial results and the breakdown of a recent election. The original work was performed in a Jupyter Notebook, which made it easier to edit and retry mistakes in either the programming or my own math, and then exported to a Python file using Visual Studio. The results of both apps are now printed directly to the terminal. These apps would be of the greatest help stored locally as a quick reference, since they require data local to the repo.
